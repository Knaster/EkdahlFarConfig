This is the Ekdahl FAR Configuration software

Please be adviced that the organization and structure of this code is TERRIBLE since i am not a Qt/Python guy and i
only learned as much as i needed to get everything working. Cleanup and restructuring is most certainly necessary.

This code has been developed using the Community version of PyCharm 2023.3.4, forms have been compiled with
QT Creator 12.0.1

Please see dependencies.txt for libraries needed to run this code, by default this code will essentially do nothing
until connected to a Teensy 4.0 with the Ekdahl FAR firmware

This software should be considered to be in Alpha stage as it is missing much functionality
