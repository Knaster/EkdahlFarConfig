This is the Ekdahl FAR Configuration software 
(https://github.com/Knaster/EkdahlFarConfig)

This software has been tested on Linux, Windows and Mac. 
It should be considered to be in beta stage as 99% of intial functionality is there but it needs to be thoroughly tested.

Initial installation procedures has been added but further testing is required.

Please be adviced that the organization and structure of this code is TERRIBLE since i am not a Qt/Python guy and i
only learned as much as i needed to get everything working. Cleanup and restructuring is most certainly necessary.
The code has been developed using the Community version of PyCharm 2023.3.4, forms have been compiled with
QT Creator 12.0.1.
by default this code will essentially do nothing until connected to a Teensy 4.0 with the Ekdahl FAR firmware
